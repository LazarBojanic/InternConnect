<h2 id="PII">1. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>Certain visitors to InternConnect's websites choose to interact with InternConnect in ways that require InternConnect
    to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that InternConnect gathers depends
    on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at https://srv1092316.hstgr.cloud
    to provide a username and email address.</p>

<h2 id="Security">2. Security</h2>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the
    Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
    protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2 id="PIIProtection">3. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>InternConnect discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of
    its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
    it on InternConnect's behalf or to provide services available at InternConnect's website, and (ii) that have agreed
    not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
    outside of your home country; by using InternConnect's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to
    them. InternConnect will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
    to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, InternConnect
    discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
    court order or other governmental request, or when InternConnect believes in good faith that disclosure is
    reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of InternConnect, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of https://srv1092316.hstgr.cloud and have supplied your email address, InternConnect
    may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
    date with what's going on with InternConnect and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
    information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
    support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
    or respond to your request or to help us support other users. InternConnect takes all measures reasonably necessary
    to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information.</p>
